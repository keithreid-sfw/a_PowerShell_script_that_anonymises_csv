# a_PowerShell_script_that_anonymises_csv

I mentioned at a conference that I can open source a powershell script that runs on restricted laptops

it does floats -> quantiles -> ints

and

it does categorical -> other ints

I havent actually got the code on this repo yet - couple of days

Contact me irl with any questions or urgencies
